B2+,73,3,They are well adapted to the new approach
B2+,73,4,Do not cry over spilt milk
B2+,73,5,May I ask you if everything is ok?
B2+,74,1,I hope you'll be feeling your usual self soon
B2+,74,2,It was not my intention to disappoint you

C1,77,1,The king has the world at his feet
C1,77,2,"We're all in the same boat, so stop complaining"
C1,77,3,"I'm in charge here now, in a manner of speaking"
C1,77,4,The government is feeling its way towards a new policy
C1,77,5,"To my mind, he is in a better position"
C1,78,1,It was just a suggestion of a smile on his face
C1,78,2,They want to have that position under their belt
C1,78,3,The parliament has spoken with one voice
C1,78,4,I could have sworn I sent the report
C1,78,5,"To sum up, we are the best candidates"
